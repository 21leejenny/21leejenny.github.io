## Short Bio
I am an honors undergraduate student in Computer Science at UC Irvine, advised by [Dr. Alex Berg](https://acberg.com/). Under Dr. Berg’s mentorship, I work on projects exploring image-text alignment and errors in vision-language models. I am also fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Pierre Baldi](https://www.igb.uci.edu/~pfbaldi/), with whom I have worked on impactful projects, including generating biomarker-based summaries for canine cancer analysis and developing machine learning models for low-resource language translation. Additionally, I am working on a helix trajectory recovery project, focusing on detecting and fitting motion patterns in data.

Recently, I have been developing an interest in game theory and optimization under the guidance of [Dr. Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/), where I investigate two-team zero-sum games and their applications.

In my free time, I enjoy paddleboarding and exploring the outdoors. I am always excited to collaborate on innovative research—feel free to reach out if you’re interested!


## Research Interest
I am interested in advancing self-supervised learning for unlabeled visual data and developing frameworks for multimodal representation alignment, with a particular emphasis on improving visual grounding.
